> If you want to be more attractive in your social as well as professional circles, always put your  best foot forward and keep growing as a person.

## YES, KEEP GROWING IS THE KEY! 
We humans are born with our very own unique traits and by working on them a bit, you can undoubtedly become the talk of the town. Here are a few important tips by which you can have your dream personality. 

1. **Dress up well -** It is said that a man is known by his dress and address. Your dressing should always be sharp, as it sets your very first impression. You dress up smart and you’re halfway through, as it boosts your confidence to a level up. A sharp dressing doesn’t mean you stay on top of every passing trend but you should be confident in whatever you wear, wear according to the occasion and last but not the least wear what suits you; as your dressing speaks volume about your personality. 
2. **Don’t always be serious -** Nobody, literally nobody wants to stay around boring or overly serious people. Try to add some humour in your conversations, but don’t overdo it.
3. **Wear your confidence -** 
4. **Socialise more -** 
5. Be yourself and not a replica
6. Stay smart and keep cool*
7. Stay optimistic in all the situations

title: Success: Make it happen
---
We all have dreams to fulfil, goals to achieve. While working towards them, we face both success as well as failures. Some people give up and quit due to fear of failure while some use their failure as stepping stones and learnings for success. Its all about our attitude towards these situations. Its our attitude that decides how far we will go. So what is the correct attitude for success? The correct attitude is a mix of five basic principles that needs to be followed religiously.

## Believe, Learn and Grow (BLG)
Never stop Believing in yourself. It all starts within you. If you don’t believe yourself, how can you expect others to believe in you. The moment you start believing in yourself, you become unstoppable. You have to have a strong belief in your self, in your ideas and in your abilities, once you get this there’s nothing that you cannot achieve.
Getting to the top is easy but staying there is the real thing which is possible only by continuous learning. Keep stretching your mind with knowledge and experience like they say “the more you know the more you grow”. Don’t cease yourself from learning. Learn even from failures (yours as well as others).

## Positive Attitude
Positive attitude attracts success and keeps you motivated and inspired. It keeps you strong through the stressful times and your hopes alive. Sometimes, things doesn’t work well and it becomes difficult to stay positive but optimism is the only way out. Don’t let negative thoughts replace positive ones because ultimately your thoughts decide your attitude and what you think over and over becomes a part of your subconscious mind and personality. Focus on your ability to meet your goals. Coach yourself with a zen attitude whenever you face a setback. Instead of crying why this happened to me, ask yourself how am I going to learn or gain from this?

## Persistence
Success is like climbing a mountain. It challenges you haunts you surprises you at every curve and only those people make it to the top who face all the challenges without giving up. You may face hurdles and they’ll only get higher and higher by the time. Jump over them, learn from them, be prepared with a good strategy and get strength for the next one. Whenever you face such setbacks and feel like quitting, say to yourself that success is close enough and you’ve gone through a lot in the past not for quitting at this moment. Its these hardships only that give you the right to succeed.

## Accept Failure
Life is a circle of success as well as failure and you’re destined to face both. Failures sometimes are there to test your strength and the best way to handle failure is to accept it and learn from it. See every failure as a new learning opportunity. You can not escape from the difficulties or setbacks and when you experience such situation, first understand it’s okay to get disappointed, take some time, let your frustration out, clear your mind, start it again with looking over the cause of failure. Start it off with new outlook and fresh learnings.

## Push your boundaries
We all are blessed with infinite potential, all we need is to unlock it. It would not just be fair to not explore your potential. Don’t impose the unnecessary burden of limits upon your mind, because when you come out of your cocoon that is when magic happens. Don’t fear the unknown, don’t feel threatened while stepping out of your comfort zone. Redefine your boundaries and capabilities, accept bigger challenges than you think you are capable of, plan your next benchmark. The world is full of tremendous opportunities, make a move unleash your potential and conquer the world.

You can become everything that you ever wanted to be. All you need is to follow these five principles.

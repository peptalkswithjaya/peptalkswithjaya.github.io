We all experience stress at times. It has become a critical and obvious part of our lives. At first it seems as an environmental pressure, and then it strains out all the peace and positivity within the person. Stress is nothing but the outcome of the interaction between an individual and environment. When situations slip out of our control, we start doubting our ability to cope well with them, and stress arise. Stress is a normal and natural part of our life, but sometimes you just need to relax.

Often, this term stress is misunderstood and is used to describe a negative state. Not all stress is bad though. Stress is simply the body’s response to the changes that create tough demands. At times, stress is required to keep up on our toes.

When stress goes beyond one’s coping abilities and the person starts feeling agitated and disturbed, eustress becomes distress. It usually affects an individual in long run and causes various illnesses.

So, what can be done to manage stress?

* **Physical Activity** – Exercise is an important tool to fight stress. When you exercise, your brain release endorphins – a chemical which is a natural painkiller and a mood enhancer which also helps you with your sleep issues. Therefore, move your body and indulge yourself in some form of exercise that involve repetitive movements and increase your heart rate. Fix an exercise routine or find an activity that you enjoy, it could be a walk or jogging or even dancing.

* **Socialise** – Build genuine and strong social connections. These connections help you get through those difficult times. Spend some time with family and friends. The emotional support or solutions (to your problems) you get from them reduces your anxiety and make you feel encouraged and confident to cope with your stressors.

* **Yoga** – Yoga is the well-known promoter of relaxation and an antidote to stress. Yoga lets your mind stay calm and composed. A 30 minutes yoga in the morning helps you declutter your mind and life throughout the day. Yoga blends pranayaam (breathing techniques) and aasan (yoga poses). Pick a couple of pranayaams which suits your physical fitness, or even begin with focussed deep breathing. Soon you will observe stress offloading your mind. Mere focussing on inhaling-exhaling and deep breathing puts your worries aside and clear your mind.

* **Meditation** – Human mind is so fickle and devilish sometimes, it plays tricks on you. The only way out is Meditation. Meditation helps in controlling your mind and redirecting your thoughts and becoming emotionally composed and stable. It leaves you with a deep state of relaxation and tranquillity by cutting down all the negative and chaotic thoughts that crowds your mind and cause stress.

* **Healing Holidays or Retreats** – Go to a quiet and seclude holiday spot, where you are away from all the hassles of life. Fortunately, we do have such aashrams and retreats dedicated for this purpose only. These places let you escape in the search of finding and allowing yourself to nothing but heal. These wellness retreats have their own anti-stress programmes and sessions to uplift, strengthen, revitalise, and relax.

* **Therapies** – If the above-mentioned things don’t work for you, then please consult with a trained physiotherapist. There are so many therapies to treat anxiety, such as cognitive behavioural therapy, psychodynamic therapy, aroma therapy, exposure therapy, nature therapy and much more. A trained psychotherapist will curate the best suited therapy for you according to your level of stress and anxiety. 

## Final Takeaway
We often get so involved in our work and everyday life, that we forget to live life. We actually run towards stress causing things and away from all the things that keeps us away from stress. Try to balance these things and your life will become much more sorted.

* Exercise more so that you worry less
* Start your day with meditation
* Spend time with family and friends
* Set a consistent yoga routine

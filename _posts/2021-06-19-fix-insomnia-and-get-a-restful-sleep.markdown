Insomnia is nothing but a sleep disorder. Having said that, it is much more worrisome than it sounds. An insomniac can neither fall asleep easily nor can stay asleep throughout the night. Sometimes wakes up in the night or too early and then not being able to get back to sleep. This sleep deprivation causes tiredness throughout the day, deteriorated health, dropped energy levels, irritability, depression and much more.

If you are suffering from insomnia, here are few things you can try for a good night’s sleep:

* **Set your Sleep and Wake Up Time**

Human bodies have Circadian Rhythm or more commonly known as Biological Clock. This clock regulates our vital biological functions, one of which is sleep-awake cycle. Circadian Rhythm works on Consistency. So, set a fixed sleep time and wake up time, and stick to it every day, even on days off. This fixed routine sets your biological clock in tune. Once its set, you automatically and easily sleep and wake up on a fixed time.


* **Get Right with the Light**

It’s all about lighting. Our biological clock is regulated by a section of brain that’s sensitive to light. When it’s daytime and all bright, our body stays awake, alert and active, and when it’s dark we feel sleepy. When it becomes dark our brain produces melatonin. Melatonin is a hormone released by pineal gland during night, and lets you sleep. Exposure for too long or too much of un-natural lights delay this process. So, dim the lights in the evening, for a restful and timely sleep. Likewise, get a good exposure of light in the morning, get out of the bed immediately and spend some time outdoors or near a window to get rid of any drowsiness.

* **Unplug before bed**

*UNPLUG IS THE NEW LUXURY!!!* Unplug yourself from mobile phones, tablets, laptops, TVs for a digital cleansing, at least an hour ago you crawl into bed. Night is the time to switch off our activities and relax the brain, same should be done with smartphone and other devices. These screens emit a blue light which hampers the production of melatonin, and keep your mind active, alert and engaged instead of relaxed and peaceful. This blue light not just interrupt your sleep quality but also your vision. Drop this habit of surfing net or scrolling through social media before sleeping right now. Rather, meditate or read a book. [Read here to know more]({% link _posts/2021-06-19-fix-insomnia-and-get-a-restful-sleep.markdown %})

* **Workout for a better sleep** 

Numerous researches have shown, exercise reduces insomnia. Exercising not just improves sleep quality but also relieves stress. The more you move, the more your body drives you to sleep at night. But don’t exhaust yourself with heavy workout. Begin with 30 minutes of light movements such as short walks, cycling, yoga or aerobics in the evening. Bring these activities in your routine and within a week, you may witness an improved sleep quality. If somehow, you don’t get to do any of these activities. Try some breathing exercise that you can do in your bed just before sleep. [Read here to know more]({% link _posts/2021-06-19-fix-insomnia-and-get-a-restful-sleep.markdown %})

* **Eating Do’s n Don’ts** 

Even after a workout you don’t seem to drop off, then probably it’s your faulty eating schedule. There should be an interval of 2-3 hours between your dinnertime and bedtime, this gives your body enough time for digestion and metabolism. Eating your meals too close to bedtime slows down your metabolism, which interferes with sound sleep. Also avoid heavy and spicy dinners, they prolong digestion and cause restlessness. Reduce your caffeine intake. Caffeine and sugar are stimulants, they keep you up through the night. Rather have a glass of warm milk, the tryptophan in milk induces sleep. So, if you are struggling to doze off, a glass of warm milk might be your tonic.

## Final Takeaway
* Stop being a couch potato and try to skip siestas.
* Avoid stimulants such as sugar & caffeine at least 4 hours before bedtime.
* Avoid heavy meals just before bedtime
* Avoid noise and bright lights.
* Swap phone with a book.

It often happens that we have so much to do but we run out of time. You will never have any additional hour so manage your time in such a manner that you don’t regret later.

## So, what is time management?
Time management is planning and controlling the amount of time you spend on specific tasks. Time management should be such that you stay engaged with your learning plus complete your work on time and still you would have time for other activities important to you, be it sports, hobbies or spending time with friends n family.

Here, are a few tips and tricks that will help you finish your things on time and will also leave you with extra time to balance it with anything that life tosses at you.

**Goal setting –** it is almost impossible to use time well if you don’t know what to do with it.

**Prioritisation –** rate your tasks according to their importance.

**Reduce distractions –** no. 1 distraction is social media. So always keep your phones away or on silent mode, switch off all social media notifications. Distraction is also caused by your internal feelings such as hunger or tiredness, so make sure that you get enough sleep and snacks n water handy.

**Master schedule –** schedule all your activities, even leisure time and set deadlines. Block off chunks of time for study or your assignments. This will help you in timely completion of your assignments or project work.

**Do one thing at a time –** it often happens that while studying you feel most tempted to check your phone but the fact is you cannot do two cognitive tasks at once. It slows down your pace so don’t jump over a new task unless you finish the earlier one. Divided attention is an inefficient way to learn. Focus on one task at a time to maximise your productivity.

**Plan your day or week to put the most important tasks –** those that will have a bigger impact- in your calendar first. Take on important activities in your high energy times, when you are at your mental peak, and reserve your low energy times for small easier tasks, like responding to mails. (how much time is wasted on low value tasks and non work related things like reading news or social media)
